# go-2fa-demo

Based on [how-to-implement-two-factor-authentication-2fa-in-golang](https://dev.to/permify/how-to-implement-two-factor-authentication-2fa-in-golang-2jg3).

What the article doesn't say is that you need a configuration for the app with google authenticator. I haven't implemented that as yet.

Hiding the api key with `.gitignore` is essential *before* you commit. You have been reminded.
